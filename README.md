### Problem Statement
>Have you ever gone to your weather app on your phone, and it shows that it’s bright skies and
no rain in sight, or maybe it’s supposed to be a high of 98 degrees, or maybe you want to see
what the weather is like somewhere else around the world. Look no further, we're here to
provide you with the utmost accuracy in weather information, allowing you to see not only your
weather information, but the weather information for when you’re on vacation next week.

### Product Objective
>Our application will give you the option to see what the temperature will be like, not only
where you are, but you can also select the location to check out what the highs and lows will be
for the family vacation next week. You also will have detailed information, allowing you to see
the wind and humidity predictions as well as sunset and sunrise.
